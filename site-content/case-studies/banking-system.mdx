# Multi-Platform Platform (Fintech)

_Spring Boot · React · Android · FastAPI (AI KYC) · ONNX/OCR_

**TL;DR** — Designed and implemented a modular platform spanning backend, web, mobile, and an AI KYC microservice. Improved KYC false-reject rate and stabilized flows under real-world constraints.

## Context & Role
Solo/lead developer across multiple layers. Objectives: secure account flows, robust KYC, and a wallet experience that can operate independently of heavier banking flows.

## Problem
- Fragmented onboarding with brittle KYC caused drop-offs and manual reviews.
- Inconsistent data boundaries across services and clients slowed iteration.
- Accuracy/latency trade-offs in OCR, face match, and liveness checks.

## Approach & Architecture
- **Domain-oriented Spring Boot** modules (auth, accounts, analytics, kyc, wallet).
- **AI KYC microservice** (FastAPI): pluggable providers; threshold tuning and retries.
- **Android Wallet**: card reload, QR pay, bill-pay; Retrofit interfaces & DTOs.
- **React Web** dashboard with a11y-first forms/tables.
- **Observability & CI**: safe defaults, lint/type checks, reproducible envs.

## Stack
Spring Boot · Hibernate · MySQL · Kotlin/Android · TypeScript/React · FastAPI · ONNX (ArcFace, SCRFD, liveness) · OCR

## Challenges & Trade-offs
- Face-match sensitivity vs UX: tuned thresholds; re-tryable capture & guidance.
- OCR noise: preprocessing + field-level confidence gating.
- Network reliability: graceful fallbacks & cached responses on mobile.

## Results
- Reduced KYC false rejects vs baseline after threshold tuning and OCR cleanup.
- Fewer manual reviews; faster re-submission loops.
- Standalone wallet flows widened the onboarding funnel.

## What’s next
- Deeper analytics for KYC decision explainability.
- Payment gateway webhooks with idempotency + retries.
