# BankApp — Android Wallet & Payments

_Kotlin · Jetpack Compose · Retrofit · Coroutines · Material 3_

**TL;DR** — Built a modern wallet feature with card reloads, QR payments, and bill-pay. A clean Retrofit API layer and resilient UI reduced visible errors and clarified flows.

## Context & Role
Android module focused on wallet flows, designed to operate even when core banking features are not available.

## Problem
- Payment flows were overly coupled to banking onboarding.
- Intermittent network caused confusing failures and abandons.

## Approach & Architecture
- Feature-based packages with screens, viewmodels, and DI.
- Retrofit interfaces: clean DTOs, interceptors, consistent error envelopes.
- Compose UI: unified components (cards, inputs, buttons) and a11y labels.
- Robust retries and offline affordances where possible.

## Stack
Kotlin · Jetpack Compose · Retrofit/OkHttp · Hilt/DI · Material 3 · Kotlin Coroutines

## Challenges & Trade-offs
- Gateway sandbox limitations: emulated webhooks and idempotent retries in dev.
- UI complexity: extracted shared components to keep code tidy and reusable.

## Results
- Reduced user-visible errors in payment flows through defensive UI and API handling.
- Faster iteration thanks to a clean, testable Retrofit layer.

## What’s next
- Native deep-linking for payment intents; richer receipt exports.
- Gateway production integration (secure storage & 3DS flows).
