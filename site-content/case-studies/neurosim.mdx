# NeuroSim — Brain Network Simulator

_Python · Flask · HTML5 Canvas · JS Front-end_

**TL;DR** — Built a browser-based neural simulator. Implemented a refractory period to prevent runaway firing and tuned rendering for smooth 60fps on mid-range devices.

## Context & Role
CS50 final project to demonstrate neuron dynamics with a clear visual model and interactive controls.

## Problem
- Naive recursion caused infinite firing loops and browser lock-ups.
- Unbounded rendering produced frame drops on modest hardware.

## Approach & Architecture
- Introduced **refractory cooldown** to each neuron after firing.
- Separated simulation tick from render loop (better use of rAF).
- Added export/import and simple APIs for persistence.

## Stack
Flask · HTML/JS · Canvas 2D · Lightweight async API calls

## Challenges & Trade-offs
- Balancing visual fidelity vs performance on lower-spec devices.
- Keeping the code approachable for learners while avoiding pitfalls.

## Results
- Smooth rendering on mid-range laptops; stable neuron firing behavior.
- Clearer demonstrations for lecture/demos; easier to reason about activity.

## What’s next
- Preset networks (small-world/random) and parameter sliders.
- Export/import of neuron graphs; richer reports.
